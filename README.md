Module 2 Capstone - TEnmo

With this capstone, our team was tasked with creating a RESTful API server and command line application which documents and stores registered users, and their balances. 
The client side application allows registered users to send and recieve TE bucks using a secure system which passes JSON web tokens through the spring framework to ensure that
registered users are who they say they are.

Official Description: "Congratulations! â€” you've landed a job with TEnmo, whose product is an online payment service for transferring "TE bucks" between friends.
However, they don't have a product yet. You've been tasked with writing a RESTful API server and command-line application."

During this project, I learned how to build a secure RESTful API server, with Java and the Spring Framework.
